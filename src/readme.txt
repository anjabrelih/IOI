Required libraries:
- streamlit
- PIL
- io

Run code:
streamlit run appC2C.py
(skip email input and localhost:xxxx automatically open in browser)


Folder contains:
- Video presentation (also includeed in the application): appC2C_video.mp3**
- Application in streamlit: appC2C.py**
- Image: fri.png**
- Test code in python: test.py (used before project was deployed on streamlit; I left butterfly.jp image in the folder so that the code would run; different image can be set in line 102)
** Leave all these files in the same folder in order to run code without errors.
